### Reflections and Comments

* I completely forgot about the 15 minute rule and spent way longer than I should have trying to set up a default.css that sets up the styles for some key html tags like 
    * `h1`-`h6`
    * `p`
    * `ol`
    * `li`
    * `strong` & `em`

#### Tools to look into for future projects
* [Browser Default Styles](https://browserdefaultstyles.com/)  
    * I did not find this until after creating the default.css. Will look into this and add it to the starter template
